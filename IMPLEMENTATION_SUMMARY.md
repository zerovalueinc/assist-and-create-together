# Company Analyzer LLM Module — Technical Architecture & Implementation Summary

## Overview
This module powers the Company Analyzer feature, providing enterprise-grade, LLM-driven company research and analysis from a single company URL. It is designed for robust data flow, strict schema enforcement, and seamless downstream integration for all future features.

---

## 1. Backend LLM Pipeline
- **Entry Point:** `POST /api/company-analyze`
- **Input:** Company URL (with or without protocol)
- **Sanitization:** URL is normalized (prepends `https://` if missing)
- **Caching:**
  - Checks for a recent cached analysis in the database (30-day expiry)
  - If cached, returns immediately (cost savings, speed)
  - If not cached or expired, triggers a new LLM analysis
- **LLM Research Agent:**
  - Uses `generateComprehensiveIBP` in `agents/claude.ts`
  - Calls Claude 3.5 Sonnet (via OpenRouter) with a strict schema prompt
  - Gathers web data, similar companies, and market intelligence
- **Strict Schema Enforcement:**
  - LLM is instructed to return a JSON object with a fixed schema (see below)
  - Backend post-processes and coerces output to this schema, filling defaults for missing fields
- **Database Save:**
  - All results are saved in the cache and reporting tables for downstream analytics and cost control

---

## 2. Strict Output Schema
The LLM and backend always return this object:
```json
{
  "companyProfile": {
    "industry": "string",
    "companySize": "string",
    "revenueRange": "string"
  },
  "decisionMakers": ["string"],
  "painPoints": ["string"],
  "researchSummary": "string",
  "website": "string",
  "companyName": "string",
  "technologies": ["string"],
  "location": "string",
  "marketTrends": ["string"],
  "competitiveLandscape": ["string"],
  "goToMarketStrategy": "string"
}
```
- All fields are always present (empty string/array if missing)
- Ready for downstream enrichment, analytics, and future features

---

## 3. Frontend Mapping
- **Component:** `src/components/CompanyAnalyzer.tsx`
- **Data Flow:**
  - Calls `/api/company-analyze` with the company URL
  - Receives a strict schema object
  - Maps fields directly to UI cards (Company Profile, Decision Makers, Research Summary)
  - No more placeholders or missing data
- **UX:**
  - User can hit Enter or click Analyze
  - Handles bare domains or full URLs

---

## 4. Extensibility & Data Taxonomy
- **All data is normalized and saved for downstream use** (lead enrichment, campaign generation, analytics, etc.)
- **Future modules** (e.g., ICP Generator, Lead Enrichment, Email Campaigns) will follow the same pattern:
  - Strict schema definition
  - LLM prompt enforcement
  - Backend validation/coercion
  - Database save for analytics and cost control
- **Documentation-first approach:**
  - Every module/feature will have a similar technical print for clarity and onboarding

---

## 5. Next Steps
- Extend this pattern to all new features
- Add more fields to the schema as needed for new UI or analytics
- Maintain this doc as the source of truth for the Company Analyzer pipeline

*This document is auto-generated and should be updated with every major change to the Company Analyzer LLM module or its schema.*
